                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The Municipality of Amsterdam wants to promote reading among students. Come often
                    students no longer go to the public library, so this is the only place they could go
                    to come and read books is the school library. For this reason they are in the school library
                    In addition to informative books, more and more novels can also be found.
                    The City wants to help secondary school students find books to read easily and quickly
                    in the school library. They want to do this with a kiosk setup: a tablet (iPad) that is fixed
                    is located at the entrance to the library. This runs an app that helps the student read a book
                    find one that suits him or her and indicates where he or she can find that book.

                <h3>Selfmade illustrations</h3>
                <p>Every illustration/animation (selfmade) is to make the process more attractive for the children</p>
                <h3>Principles of User Interface</h3>
                <p>One primary action per screen: applied by making one screen per step in the selecting process</p>
                <p>Progressive disclosure: The design provides clarity and is organized by progressive disclosure as some options only appear when another option is chosen. This also makes it more fun for children.</p>
                <p>Consistency: Every page has the same flow and layout to make it simpler to use</p>
