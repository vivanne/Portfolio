                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Vivanne! I'm a second-year student at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam, pursuing a degree in Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD). This program has been instrumental in improving my skills as a frontend developer and UX designer.
                    A minimalist style has been nurtured in my designs, evolving with each project undertaken. Blending artistic elements into simple layouts presents an enjoyable challenge for me. Projects, in my view, should be well-organized and structured, and I have a keen eye for specific skills I aim to develop.
                <p>Beyond my studies, a passion for reading and quality time with two wonderful friends in our Amsterdam apartment fills my days. Cozy nights in with them are something I always look forward to. Leiden is where I grew up, but the allure of experiencing life in the big city as a student led me to move, and now I couldn't imagine it any other way.</p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>Prior to joining THUAS for the CMD program, I took a gap year to explore and define my career path. During this time, I delved into various courses and discovered a passion for creativity. Utilizing the Udemy platform, I progressed from a novice to an intermediate level in both Graphic Design and UX Design.</p>

            <p>I am currently in my second year of CMD in Amsterdam, and surprisingly, I've developed a strong affinity for coding. While my primary learning goals lean towards programming, my deep passion for UX design has led me to the decision to pursue both areas.</p>

            <p>I am eager to enhance my JavaScript skills during my internship and am hopeful of joining a team that can provide valuable support in this regard. In addition to JavaScript, I am keen on refining my CSS skills by concentrating more on CSS animations and creating responsive designs. I am currently working on mastering Figma, and so far, progress has been promising. Illustrator is my favorite tool for creating flat design illustrations.</p>
