                <p>Imagine and design a multi-device experience for a specific activity (travel, fitness, cinema visits, ...). In particular, consider the user goals that are important before, during and after this activity, and which device would be most suitable at which stage.Visualize your solutions in a screenflow so that the functionality of your product is fully mapped on all devices used.</p>

                    <h3>User scenario</h3>
                    <p>Barbara Kuitert is a single, hardworking woman. After a day of intense work at the hospital, she looks forward to being able to relax as quickly as possible, knowing she may be called in again. Using her smart oven, she can preheat it remotely. She takes out her phone, inputs her oven settings and the timer indicating when the oven should be ready for use. Clicking on the preheat option, she sees on her phone's interface the progress of the oven preheating on the home screen. Simultaneously, the oven at home has received notifications indicating remote control, ensuring that it won't be occupied unexpectedly. Upon arriving home, she receives a notification that the oven has been successfully preheated. Now, she can immediately throw in the pizza when she enters. Barbara can now enjoy a less stressful evening, quickly settling on the couch to unwind.</p>

                    <h3>Research methods</h3>
                    <p>By making screenflows of the following applications I was able to analyse different designpatterns and functions to implement in my own design</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Design patterns</h4>
                            <p>I analysed apps as Google Maps, Forest and the Iphone alarm to find design patterns to use.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>User Journey</h4>
                            <p>Making the User journey gave me insights in what device I should use in what moment.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Visual Design Research</h4>
                            <p>Before making the high fidelity screens I did some visual research, ensuring that the final visual elements meets the users needs, align with my project goal, and contribute to a positive and effective user experience.</p>
